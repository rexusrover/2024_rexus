A PositionConstraint can (and probably should) be used for such purposes.~%~%# The radius of the disc that should be maintained visible~%float64 target_radius~%~%# The pose of the disc; as the robot moves, the pose of the disc may change as well~%# This can be in the frame of a particular robot link, for example~%geometry_msgs/PoseStamped target_pose~%~%# From the sensor origin towards the target, the disc forms a visibility cone~%# This cone is approximated using many sides. For example, when using 4 sides,~%# that in fact makes the visibility region be a pyramid.~%# This value should always be 3 or more.~%int32 cone_sides~%~%# The pose in which visibility is to be maintained.~%# The frame id should represent the robot link to which the sensor is attached.~%# It is assumed the sensor can look directly at the target, in any direction.~%# This assumption is usually not true, but additional PositionConstraints~%# can resolve this issue.~%geometry_msgs/PoseStamped sensor_pose~%~%# Even though the disc is maintained visible, the visibility cone can be very small~%# because of the orientation of the disc with respect to the sensor. It is possible~%# for example to view the disk almost from a side, in which case the visibility cone~%# can end up having close to 0 volume. The view angle is defined to be the angle between~%# the normal to the visibility disc and the direction vector from the sensor origin.~%# The value below represents the minimum desired view angle. For a perfect view,~%# this value will be 0 (the two vectors are exact opposites). For a completely obstructed view~%# this value will be Pi/2 (the vectors are perpendicular). This value defined below~%# is the maximum view angle to be maintained. This should be a value in the open interval~%# (0, Pi/2).

Closer to zero means less important)~%float64 weight~%~%================================================================================~%MSG: moveit_msgs/VisibilityConstraint~%# The constraint is useful to maintain visibility to a disc (the target) in a particular frame.~%# This disc forms the base of a visibiliy cone whose tip is at the origin of the sensor.~%# Maintaining visibility is done by ensuring the robot does not obstruct the visibility cone.~%# Note:~%# This constraint does NOT enforce minimum or maximum distances between the sensor~%# and the target, nor does it enforce the target to be in the field of view of~%# the sensor. A PositionConstraint can (and probably should) be used for such purposes.~%~%# The radius of the disc that should be maintained visible~%float64 target_radius~%~%# The pose of the disc; as the robot moves, the pose of the disc may change as well~%# This can be in the frame of a particular robot link, for example~%geometry_msgs/PoseStamped target_pose~%~%# From the sensor origin towards the target, the disc forms a visibility cone~%# This cone is approximated using many sides. For example, when using 4 sides,~%# that in fact makes the visibility region be a pyramid.~%# This value should always be 3 or more.~%int32 cone_sides~%~%# The pose in which visibility is to be maintained.~%# The frame id should represent the robot link to which the sensor is attached.~%# It is assumed the sensor can look directly at the target, in any direction.~%# This assumption is usually not true, but additional PositionConstraints~%# can resolve this issue.~%geometry_msgs/PoseStamped sensor_pose~%~%# Even though the disc is maintained visible, the visibility cone can be very small~%# because of the orientation of the disc with respect to the sensor. It is possible~%# for example to view the disk almost from a side, in which case the visibility cone~%# can end up having close to 0 volume. The view angle is defined to be the angle between~%# the normal to the visibility disc and the direction vector from the sensor origin.~%# The value below represents the minimum desired view angle. For a perfect view,~%# this value will be 0 (the two vectors are exact opposites). For a completely obstructed view~%# this value will be Pi/2 (the vectors are perpendicular). This value defined below~%# is the maximum view angle to be maintained. This should be a value in the open interval~%# (0, Pi/2). If 0 is set, the view angle is NOT enforced.~%float64 max_view_angle~%~%# This angle is used similarly to max_view_angle but limits the maximum angle~%# between the sensor origin direction vector and the axis that connects the~%# sensor origin to the target frame origin.
